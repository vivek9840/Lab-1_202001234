### Q.1. Identify FRs and NFRs

### **Functional requirment** >>

- **Login page and sign up page**

> the system should have a login page for student,proffesors,employees and othe guest users. the admin should have diffrent et of role and acces to the system compare to other users. teh login page should have distinct field for proffesor,student,and employee and the guest user.

- **Book databse access**

> the system should have been connected to the system and should give acces to the database to authentic users. the system should keep trake of the books, which are borrowed by whom and when. also it should have data of ahich book is where in the shelf with name, type, author etc with borrowing history. the user should be able to access the database of books and should be able to manipulat of serch the data from given role and their acccess,like search book, lock the book for themselves, edit the info if the user is admin.

- **Borrow system for all the users**

> the system should provide the feature to borrow books from the library from there devices. the user should be able to borrow and return the book from the library without anyother person't need.

- **sign in for new or guest users**

> the system should allow the new user or guest users to create a new account or register in the system for the first time if they are not registered i the system for the latter use.

### **Non-functional requirment** >>

- **Scalability**

> the system should be scalable for fulfill the requirment of all the student,proffesors and employees. the system should not have bottle neck of number of users.

- **Usability**

> the system should be easy enought to learn for all the users like students,proffedors ,employees and other users. the system should have easy to understand and useable user interface.

- **Data integrity**

> the system should have data integrity to keep record of all the books and shelf information for library and the borrower.

- **Security**

> the system should be secure from unauthorized access of other non-valid users. the system should also prevent malware attacks. it should prevent information leaks from the system and database like password leak book lnfo leak and data temparing.

- **Maintainability**

> the system should be easy to maintain and restructured if it's needed.

- **Manageability**

> the system should be easy to manage for admin to manage all the information about books and the borrower of the book. the system should provide features to access and manipulate the information about books easily.

- **Reliability**

> the systems should be reliable for all the user to access. the system should prevent crashes and failures and if that happens, the system should be able to recover the lossd in the system and deploy again.

- **Performance**

> the performance of the system should be good enought to run while many users are using the system at the same time. the requirment of the system to run on any device should be optimal for the device. the system should not lag or crash in use of many users.

### Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem

### **Scope**

> the system can scale to the 466M users. the system can provide easy to user application for day to day life and provide an support for their hearing loss. the system can user alternative componantes of device like speaker for loud voice signal or vibrator for vibrational info to the user. the system can preventaccident or help the user to ease the task which require hearing or sudden responces.

### **Features**

> the features of the system are following : the system can provide a service to the required user without any performance issue and with minimum error. the system should be fast and the latency of the system should be low due to the requirment of the application is critical. the system should be able to identify user with diffrent type of inputs like finger print, voice or face detection. the responce of the application should be clear wnought that user can understand the response of the application in critical situation.

### **Non-functional Aspect**

> the non-functional aspect of the system is that it should be able to work in real time with low latency and the system should be able to identify the user by diffrent ways. the system should be accurate and fast for emergency issues. the system should be able to inform usr by diffrent ways like vibration or loud noices. the system should be scalable, fast and reliable.
